# Purpose:


# Maven :
Selenium WebDriver is great for browser automation. But, when using it for testing and building a test framework, it feels underpowered. Integrating Maven with Selenium provides following benefits
Apache Maven provides support for managing the full lifecycle of a test project.

Maven is used to define project structure, dependencies, build, and test management.
Using pom.xml(Maven) you can configure dependencies needed for building testing and running code.
Maven automatically downloads the necessary files from the repository while building the project

# Project Structure : 

# src/main/java: Java source code for common methods across the application goes here
    
     # ReusableComponents : This is a package which accomodates the class files reused in the scripted testcases
    
        # CheckBox.java :   This class has methods to verify a checkbox and to select a checkbox 
                     
                                  oCheckBox.isDisplayed() : Verifies if the checkbox is displayed in webpage and returns a boolean value
                                  oCheckBox.isEnabled() : Verifies if the checkbox is enabled in webpage and returns a boolean value
                                  oCheckBox.isSelected() : Verifies if the checkbox is selected in webpage and returns a boolean value
                                  oCheckBox.click() : Selects the choosen checkbox
        
        # DroDown.java : This has methods to choose an option from dropdown by passing the chossen option to "switch case"
        
                                  selectByVisibleText() : command can be used to select a list option from the Drop Down field using its                                                             Label Text.
                                  selectByValue() : command is used to select the list option using the specified value of the List Option                                                      from the multi-selection Box field.
                                  selectByIndex() : command is used to select the list option using the specified Index of the List Option                                                       from the multi-selection Box field.
